        <h2>About  Forest </h2>
        <p>
          Forests are vast areas covered primarily with trees, plants, and
          undergrowth. They play a critical role in maintaining Earth's
          ecological balance by providing oxygen, regulating climate, and
          supporting diverse wildlife. Forests are categorized into tropical,
          temperate, and boreal types, each hosting unique ecosystems and
          species. They cover about 31% of the Earthâ€™s surface and provide
          shelter to 80% of terrestrial species.

        <h2>About Water Bodies</h2>
        <p>
          Water bodies, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and ponds, are vital
          for sustaining life on Earth. Oceans, which cover over 70% of
          Earth's surface, regulate the planet's climate and support marine
          biodiversity. Freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes provide
          drinking water and habitats for numerous species. These ecosystems
          are essential for human survival, agriculture, and industry, making
          their preservation crucial.

        <h2>About Reptiles</h2>
        <p>
          Reptiles are cold-blooded animals covered with scales, including
          snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles. Found on every continent
          except Antarctica, they rely on external heat to regulate their body
          temperature. Reptiles play a vital role in ecosystems as both
          predators and prey, helping maintain the balance of nature. They
          inhabit diverse environments, from deserts to rainforests, and
          include both venomous and non-venomous species.
