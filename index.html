            <h2>Reptiles</h2>
            <p>Reptiles are cold-blooded animals with scales, including snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles. They are found in various habitats and play crucial roles in the ecosystem as predators and prey.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Found on every continent except Antarctica</li>
                <li>Rely on external heat to regulate body temperature</li>
                <li>Include venomous and non-venomous species</li>

    <p class="overflow-shape">Wildlife refers to all animals, plants, and microorganisms that live in their natural habitats without human interference. It includes creatures ranging from tiny insects to majestic mammals like lions and elephants, all of which play a vital role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Wildlife contributes to the health of the environment by pollinating plants, dispersing seeds, and controlling pests. However, human activities such as deforestation, poaching, and pollution are threatening wildlife, pushing many species to the brink of extinction. Protecting wildlife is essential not only for biodiversity but also for the survival of humanity, as a healthy ecosystem supports clean air, water, and fertile soil.
